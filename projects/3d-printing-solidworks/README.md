# 🧩 3D Printing Project — SolidWorks Modeling & Assembly

This project contains 3D models and assemblies created in **SolidWorks** as part of a practical engineering activity involving CAD modeling and preparation for **3D printing**.

The parts were modeled individually, adjusted for print tolerances, and then assembled to verify fitment and mechanical behavior.

---

## 🛠️ Project Scope

- 3D modeling of individual components  
- Creation of final assembly to validate dimensions  
- Adjustment for 3D printer tolerances  
- Export for slicing and printing  
- Fit-test performed after printing  
- Iterations of improved versions (ex: *Presilha 2.0, 3.0, 3.5*)  

---

## 📁 Files Included

### **Parts (.SLDPRT)**  
- Meia-Peça.SLDPRT  
- Part1.SLDPRT  
- Conector2.SLDPRT  
- Presilha.SLDPRT
