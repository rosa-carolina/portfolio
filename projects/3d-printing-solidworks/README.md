# 🧩 3D Printing Project — SolidWorks Modeling & Assembly

This project contains 3D models and assemblies created in **SolidWorks** as part of a practical engineering activity involving CAD modeling and preparation for **3D printing**.

The parts were modeled individually, adjusted for print tolerances, and then assembled to verify fitment and mechanical behavior.

---

## 🛠️ Project Scope

- 3D modeling of individual components  
- Creation of final assembly to validate dimensions  
- Adjustment for 3D printer tolerances  
- Export for slicing and printing  
- Fit-test performed after printing  
- Iterations of improved versions (ex: *Presilha 2.0, 3.0, 3.5*)

## 📌 Notes

## 📌 Notes

This project was developed as part of a **group assignment** focused on creating and improving a **toy designed for children with special needs**.  
The work involved collaborative CAD modeling, iterative design, mechanical adjustments, and preparation for 3D printing to ensure safety, usability, and accessibility.

More design iterations and improvements may be added as the project evolves.
