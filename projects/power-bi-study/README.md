# 📊 Power BI Study Project

This project is a Power BI dashboard created as part of my learning journey in data visualization, business intelligence, and analytical reporting.  
It demonstrates my ability to work with data modeling, build interactive visuals, and design clean and effective dashboards.

## 🌐 Dashboard Overview

The dataset used in this project contains sales information, allowing the creation of visuals that answer business questions such as:

- Which product categories generate the most revenue?
- How does total sales distribution vary across regions?
- What is the contribution of each category within the total revenue?
- How do states, gender, and months influence sales performance?

Below are snapshots of the report pages included in the `.pbix` file.
