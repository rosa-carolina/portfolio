# 📊 Power BI Study Project

This project contains a Power BI dashboard developed as part of my learning journey in data visualization and business intelligence.  
It focuses on sales analysis, visual exploration of categories, regional insights, and interactive filters.

---

## 🌐 Dashboard Overview

The report explores business questions such as:

- Which product categories generate the highest revenue?
- How does sales distribution change by region?
- Which segments contribute most to total sales?
- How do filters (month, gender, region, state) change the view?

Below you can see screenshots from the dashboard included in the `.pbix` file.
